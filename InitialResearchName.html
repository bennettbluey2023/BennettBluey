<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->    
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes --> 
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag --> 
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

       <h2> <p>Problem Statement</p> Athletes have no consistent, supportive way to talk about mental health struggles they face, which leads to them bottling up their mental health pressures. Athletes are expected to simply perform 100% of the time and face criticsm when they do not play well. </h2> 
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-5 text-success">
        <h2> <p>Need Statement</p> All athletes, whether high school or professional need to have a resource where they can talk to each other about mental health struggles and strategies to fix them. They can hear from each other and find solutions from hearing from other athletes who experience the same issues.  
        </h2>

        Social media is a massive factor that leads to the negative mental health struggles professional athletes face. On social media, fans and critics can hide behind a screen to type whatever they want which leads to slander, hate, and the forming of agendas against players. Although many players may say they never see or listen to the hate, it is nearly impossible for players not to see any of the hate on social media. Players do notice it, and it can affect negatively on the field/court, and in their personal life.

      <div class="col border border-5 text-success p-3 mb-2 bg-warning">
        For student-athletes, factors that contribute to mental health struggles include pressure to perform to reach the next level, keeping up with school work, social anxieties (friend groups, girlfriend/boyfriend), and family life. Balancing these factors is difficult and if performance on the field is not good, it can lead to poor grades, less hanging out with friends/family etc.  33% of all college students experience significant symptoms of depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions. Among that group, 30% seek help. But of college athletes with mental health conditions, only 10% do.
